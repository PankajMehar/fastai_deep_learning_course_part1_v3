Some of the birds are tamed to the point that they will sit on your head or hand.  They use specialized habitat, old relict sand dunes such as is seen at this site.  They are quite sedentary as well, living in family oriented groups consisting of a breeding pair and several ""helpers"" which are usually young male offspring of the breeding pair.  Female offspring tend to move on and breed at a younger age than males.  Their habitat has been largely lost due to development, mainly for houses and citrus, or habitat degradation due to fire suppression.  Fires would occur infrequently in the historic landscape, maybe every 5-20 years depending on vegetation type.  The more herbaceous material, the more inclined the area is to burn.  Fires were patchy, leaving patches of unburned refugia for the sedentary birds.",,,,Aphelocoma coerulescens,flsjay,Species,18837,,,4,3,committed,,https://ebird.org/profile/MTE1NTI0,,,https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/76504641,https://ebird.org/view/checklist/S40752194,https://ebird.org/species/flsjay
